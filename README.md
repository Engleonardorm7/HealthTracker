# HealthTracker

## Health Tracker with Calorie Suggestions and AI Integration

This project is a web application designed to help users track their daily calorie intake, manage their diet, and receive personalized meal recommendations based on their health goals. Users can input their weight, height, activity level, and daily food intake. The application integrates the MyFitnessPal API to fetch calorie and nutrition data for various foods.

The application consists of a Django backend to manage user profiles, food entries, and AI-powered recommendation algorithms, and a React frontend for an intuitive user experience.

## Key Features:

User authentication and profile management.
Integration with MyFitnessPal API for accurate calorie and nutrition data.
AI-driven meal recommendations based on user input and goals.
Frontend built with React, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.
